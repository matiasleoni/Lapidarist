## The problem

This problem is for you to:

* Show your abilities in data loading, cleaning and descriptive analysis. Some rows contain errors. Extra points: clean these rows and include them in your analysis.

* Show your modeling abilities. Bonus points for testing your model’s error using a test set.


The limousine comes to a full stop. As the driver gets out to open the door you take a deep breath and get inside. Inside the meeting room you find the Prime Minister, accompanied by a fat, tall man and a short, deform one with long ears and an even longer nose.

- **Prime Minister**: “Ah! You’re here! Great! Let me introduce my guests. This is Fidelious, Minister of Magic, and Krenk, the owner of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank.”
- **You**: “Uhhh, ma’am, is this a joke?”
- **Fidelious**: “Not at all, but don’t worry, don’t sweat the details, tomorrow you won’t remember anything. Security measures, you see.”
- **Krenk**: “Let’s move things along. I don’t like to be exposed to Muggles.”
- **You**: “What...” The Prime Minister interrupts you.
- **Prime Minister**: “Our friends here seem to have run into a bit of an issue, see, some diamonds seem to have been stolen from the bank. Problem is, the only person... goblin, sorry, ...who saw the diamonds prior to the robbery is our distinguished guest, Krenk.”
- **Fidelious**: “And while the Ministry completely believes Krenk as to the diamonds’ worth, we need another person to validate his claim. Safety policies, you see.”
- **Prime Minister**: “So, since you’re the best data scientist in our country, I thought you could help. Mr. Krenk will provide you with the characteristics of the missing diamonds so you can give us an estimate of how much the stolen diamonds are worth.”
- **You**: “But I’m not a lapidarist.”
- **Prime Minister**: “Which is why we’re providing you with a huge dataset, containing characteristics and prices for tens of thousands of diamonds. Now, get working.“

“Huge? Tens of thousands?“ You think. “And I thought I was the clueless one here.”
